In this project I used:
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Jquery(for different effects)
* Gulp building system
* BEM methodology
* Bootstrap
* Flexbox
Also I made my own notes in different parts of HTML and CSS documents, described JS functionality.
I spent about 26 hours to complete the task. This project met the biggest part of requirements. You can see vendor prefixes, burger menu and so on, also itâ€™s adaptive for:
320-467px;
467-768px;
768-992px;
992-1024px;
1024+px;
I hope you will be satisfied.
