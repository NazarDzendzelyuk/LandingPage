In this project I used:
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JQUERY( for scrolling and hover effects)
* Gulp building system
* BEM methodology
* Bootstrap
* Flexbox
Also I commented the main parts in HTML and CSS documents, described JS functionality.
I spent about 24 hours to complete the task. 	 I have met all the requirements for the project. You can see vendor prefixes, also it’s adaptive for:
320-467px;
467-768px;
768-992px;
992-1024px;
1024+px;
